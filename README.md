First intall webpack dependency :

```npm i -D webpack```

Now intall webpack globally if not before :

```npm -g i webpack```

If it is not above 2.0 then use :

npm view webpack versions OR npm view webpack versions --json

```npm i -D webpack@3.0.0```

In webpack commands "-p" use for minified the code or for production
like ```webpack ./src/app.js ./dist/app.bundle.js -p```
